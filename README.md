### How to install Xpenology?
In order to install Expenology we need to have two things:
<ul>
    <li>A USB drive with the Xpenology boot-loader</li>
    <li>A pc with supported hardware</li>
</ul>


### How to create an Xpenology USB boot-loader on a Mac?
You will need to collect some information and some files before we can start with this process. First let’s create a folder called Xpenology on your desktop. We will use this folder as our project folder and will place all relevant files in here. Create a text file in Xpenology/ called config.txt

<ul>
    <li>Lets first get the information, write the following information in your config.txt file:
        <ul>
            <li>The USB drive’s PIV and VID</li>
            <li>The Mac address of the network cards that you plan to use in your build</li>
            <li>A auto generated serial number from the link below.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Lets now get the files. Download the following files into your Xpenology/ folder:
        <ul>
            <li>JUN’s boot-loader from the link below</li>
            <li>Finally Synology’s DSM version that works well with your boot-loader</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
